chatgpt description 
The **Laser-Lymbal** is a versatile and innovative device housed in a secure, PIN-locked enclosure, ensuring safety and controlled access. Upon unlocking, the system's laser gimbal mechanism either deploys automatically using motors and gears or can be manually lifted, offering flexibility in operation. At its core, an ESP32-CAM mounted on the gimbal enables advanced facial recognition and person tracking, seamlessly directing the laser's movements for precise targeting. Beyond functionality, the device also features a captivating aesthetic mode, allowing the laser to create mesmerizing long-exposure light painting effects, blending technology with art.
